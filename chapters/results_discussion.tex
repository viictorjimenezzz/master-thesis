- It's difficult to assess P2 (independence of robustness metric on the task
performance of the model) because more complex models will be better able
to represent invariant features (if proper regularization is performed) than
less complex models, and complexity (again, if properly regularized) drives also
task performance. For that reason, we will reproduce the results of the 
Example (classifiers) with posterior agreement. \\

- Justify that the hypothesis class in the OOD case is implicitly
considered to be the union of the hypothesis classes of each of
the random variables. Maybe this belongs to section 3.1.2 \\
